<h1> About </h1>
Hi there! I’m Aiswarya. I’m currently pursuing Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon and plan to leverage my coursework and professional skills in my upcoming endeavors. I’m seeking full-time opportunities in CS/ECE starting in January 2021.

I also possess a hearing disability so I use a cochlear implant and spoken English to communicate.

Got questions or suggestions? Feel free to email me! You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinodku/).
