<h1>Projects </h1>
<p>
I've done several projects over the years which dip into natural language processing and deep learning/machine learning. Some of these were for fun, were part of coursework or were research projects. 
</p>

<h2>Safety of Shared Control in Autonomous Driving</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identifying potential weak-points of ML models which analyze the response time of drivers in vehicles where the aim is to improve handover between system and driver in autonomous vehicles. </li>
  <li>Training and testing the models with adversarial examples using Cleverhans in TensorFlow to improve robustness of the model.</li>
  <li>Evaluating performance of the models with different adversarial robustness libraries such as ART and Cleverhans.</li>
</ul>


<h2> Mask-Proxy Loss for Text-Independent Speaker Verification</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborated in applying proxy-based loss in speaker recognition which achieved state of the art equal error rate (EER).</li>
  <li>Analyzed different loss techniques like center loss, triplet loss, mask proxy loss to determine best performance. </li>
  <li>Trained CNN models with self-attention pooling in PyTorch using AWS on the 6,000+ speaker VoxCeleb database.</li>
</ul>
