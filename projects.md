<h1>Projects </h1>
<p>
I've done several projects over the years which dip into natural language processing and deep learning/machine learning. Some of these were for fun, were part of coursework or were research projects.

<h3>Safety of Shared Control in Autonomous Driving</h3>
<i>Graduate Research Project/Research Assistant</i><br>
<em>Supervisor: Dr.Corina Pasareanu, CyLab CMU</em><br>
<i>Team Size: 4</i>
* Collaboration between CyLab CMU, University of Virginia and University of York, England.<br>
* Identifying potential weak-points of ML models which analyze the response time of drivers in vehicles where the aim is to improve handover between system and driver in autonomous vehicles. <br>
* Training and testing the models with adversarial examples using Cleverhans in TensorFlow to improve robustness of the model.<br>
* Evaluating performance of the models with different adversarial robustness libraries such as ART and Cleverhans.<br>
* Technology/libraries: Docker, TensorFlow, Marabou, Python, ART, Cleverhans<br>



<h3> Mask-Proxy Loss for Text-Independent Speaker Verification</h3>
<i>Graduate Research Project></i><br>
<em>Supervisor: Dr. Bhiksha Raj Ramakrishnan, CMU </em><br>
<i> Team Size: 2</i>
* Collaborated in applying proxy-based loss in speaker recognition which achieved state of the art equal error rate (EER).<br>
* Analyzed different loss techniques like center loss, triplet loss, mask proxy loss to determine best performance. <br>
* Trained CNN models with self-attention pooling in PyTorch using AWS on the 6,000+ speaker VoxCeleb database.<br>
* Technology/libraries: AWS, Python, Numpy, PyTorch<br>
* ArXiv: [Mask-Proxy Loss for Text-Independent Speaker Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04491)<br>
